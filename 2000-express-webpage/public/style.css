        You must place this file in the public/ folder

        This css file is referred to inside the index.html file.
        
            <link href="/static/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
        

         As soon as any browser loads the index.html file, it will make a request
        to your express server for the /static/style.css endpoint .
        
        We did not create an endpoint for this file inside server.js . However,
        in our server.js file we have a line that created the endpoint for us:
        
        app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname + '/public'))
        
        `}
}
